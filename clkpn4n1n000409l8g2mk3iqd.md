# Introduction

Hey there, friends! Can you believe we're already at the midpoint of 2023? It's the perfect time to take a breather, look back, and appreciate all the experiences that have shaped us so far. I don't know about you, but for me, this year has been one heck of a rollercoaster ride filled with emotions, challenges, and exciting opportunities. Looking back at the past six months, I can't help but feel amazed at how much I've grown and evolved.

By the way, I'm Kelvin Parmar, and I'm excited to share my journey from the start of 2023 with you all. So, let's dive in and see what this year has brought my way!

Hey there! Let's take a look at the beginning of 2023:

# January 2023 :

So, the start of 2023 was quite exciting for me as I had just completed my 7th semester and moved on to the 8th semester. During our last semester, we had the opportunity to choose two subjects and work on a project. Our team decided to work on a project based on the cloud native ecosystem. It was an ambitious plan to create a full-stack application and containerize it using Docker, and then deploy it to Kubernetes. However, during our presentation, we faced a little challenge. It seemed like the professors had some trouble understanding the scope and concept of our final-year project. Their expressions were quite amusing when I began my presentation!

So, the professors gave some feedback on your project, and they mentioned that it didn't quite make sense to them, so they decided to reject it. I was frustrated at the time. You believed in the potential of those technologies and thought they would become trending, but it seemed like they didn't quite see it that way. But you know what? It's essential to remember that everyone has different perspectives, and that's okay! Maybe they weren't ready to embrace those new ideas in their field. Don't let it discourage you though, keep exploring and innovating - who knows, you might find other great opportunities along the way! Keep your passion alive! ðŸ˜Š

# February 2023 :

Oh, guess what? I'm already two months into this exciting journey of 2023! It's been a lot of fun exploring the world of open source and making some cool contributions to web development. But you know what made it even more amazing? I got in touch with Apache Devlake, and that opened up a whole new adventure for me! I started exploring their projects and happily made some contributions there too. I must say, that organization is simply fantastic, and I can't wait to see what other awesome things are in store for me on this journey! ðŸ˜„

# March 2023:

Can you believe it? I've already reached the third month of this amazing journey! Exciting news - I got selected as a content writer at the [**DevsInTech**](https://devsintech.hashnode.dev/) community! It feels fantastic to be a part of such a wonderful team. And guess what? I also made another great achievement this month! Thanks to the founder of the [**WomenInCloudNative**](https://blog.womenincloudnative.com/) community, [**Nancy Chauhan**](https://hashnode.com/@womenincloudnative), I got introduced to **Lian**. Such a fantastic opportunity! But wait, there's more! I've taken up DevOps to expand my skills and learn even more. Super pumped for all the opportunities coming my way! ðŸ˜„

# April 2023:

Guess what? In the fantastic month of April, something super exciting happened to me! I won my very first giveaway, courtesy of the awesome [Daily. dev](http://Daily.dev) team. How cool is that?

And that's not all â€“ as the month drew to a close, I embarked on a new adventure and started diving into the world of Docker. It was a bit of a learning curve, but I managed to containerize my very first project: a calculator! Can you believe it?

# May 2023:

I just had the most amazing experience this month in 2023. I attended my very first Docker meetup hosted by the awesome Bhavya Sachdeva. It was such a great opportunity to learn more about Dockerfiles and a bunch of other cool stuff. And you know what? Toward the end of the meetup, something incredible happened â€“ I won my first Docker hoodie! Can you believe it? Winning that hoodie has given me a serious boost of energy to keep learning and exploring new things. I'm feeling super motivated to dive even deeper into the world of Docker. Yay! ðŸŽ‰

Oh, and that's not all - this month, I also graduated! Entering corporate life has been a great experience, and I'm excited to see what the future holds. Cheers to new beginnings and exciting adventures ahead!

# June 2023:

I can't contain my excitement as this month has been amazing for me! I've been diving headfirst into the fascinating world of DevOps and content writing, not to mention exploring the joys of blogging and so much more. It all started with winning my very first Hashnode challenge, thanks to the incredible support from the WeMakeDevs community. What an incredible feeling!

And guess what? The good news doesn't end there! I am thrilled to share that I've been selected as a DevOps team member in the wonderful GrowInComm community. I feel honored to be a part of such a talented and passionate group of people.

I finally cracked my first front-end job, and now I've officially entered the exciting world of corporate life. It's been such an incredible journey, filled with learning and growth. I can't wait to see what the future holds and to keep honing my skills in this new adventure. Thanks for being a part of my journey, and here's to many more fantastic experiences ahead! ðŸŽ‰
