# History of Python

- Python was created in 1989 by **Guido Van Rossum**. 

- In the 1980's he was working on his project at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)  which is situated in the Netherland. That was hobby project because he was looking for an interesting project to keep him occupied during Christmas. He was using **ABC** programming language at that time, which was an interface with operating system and handled exceptions.

- He had learned the syntax of ABC and some of its good features. It came with a lot of complaints too, so he fixed those issues completely and created a good scripting language that removed all the flaws.

- Following that, he had decided that the name came from BBC TV show ** Monty Python's Flying Circus
 **,  as he was a big fan of the show, and he wanted a short, unique, and slightly mysterious name for his invention; thus, he names it **PYTHON**.

# Introduction to Python

# Why we need to learn python?


- Easy to learn

- Object-Oriented

- Portable

- Powerful and high level language

- Simply looks like English language
# How it is different from the other languages?

- In other languages compiler first compiles the language and then convert into byte code and that byte code gives the output.

- But in python it is directly interpreted into machine instructions and gives the output directly.

# Applications of Python :-

- Python is mostly used in Web development as a framework called Flask and Django.

- Python is also use in DevOps for automation related tasks to write a scripts.

- Data science

- Machine Learning

- Artificial Intelligence

- Game development
